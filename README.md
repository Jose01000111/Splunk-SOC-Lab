# ⚡ Home SIEM for SOC Lab 🧠

Welcome to my Home SOC Lab project!  
This repository documents the creation of a **Splunk Enterprise Security (ES)** lab — simulating a mini **Security Operations Center (SOC)** using Ubuntu virtual machines.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Build a **home SIEM environment** with Splunk Enterprise  
- Configure a server and endpoint for **log ingestion & analysis**  
- Practice **SOC workflows**, **alert triage**, and **data visualization**  
- Document everything for continuous learning and sharing  

---

## 🏗️ Lab Environment
| Role | OS | Purpose |
|------|----|----------|
| Splunk Server | Ubuntu 22.04 | Host Splunk Enterprise & Enterprise Security |
| Endpoint VM | Ubuntu 22.04 | Generate logs and forward to Splunk Server |

---

### Ⅰ️⃣ Phase I — Environment Setup 🧱  
- Prepare both Ubuntu VMs (update, upgrade, clean unnecessary packages)  
- Create project folders for lab files and logs  
- Gather system info (OS version, IPs, hostname)
